Wrtie something here later if it's necessary


Just test this code on cpu
GPU might not be faster since the model is very small (and I didn't put any .cuda() in it)

## Installation
All requirements should be detailed in requirements.txt. Using virtual environment is recommended.
```
    (optional) virtualenv .
    (optional) source bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the code
```
    python AverageDQN_torch.py
```
